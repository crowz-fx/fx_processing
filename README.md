This is a container for all of the processing and p5.js sketches that I create, some are based from tutorials, some made completely from scratch and the rest is a combination!

### Fractal Trees
This is a "tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches and sequential access" [(Wikipedia)][1]. This isn't a true implementation of the algorithm used for fractal trees; however the graphical result of this sketch is very near of that.

### Starfield Paralax
A Star Wars inspired hyperspeed travel through the stars. Mimics what it would be like if you could travel at hyperspeed where the stars would form lines as you catch up to the light? (is that even correct?).
